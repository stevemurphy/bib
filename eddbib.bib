@book{Holstein1995,
	Abstract = {(from "Series Editors Introduction", p. vii)

_The Active Interview_ takes a constructionist perspective on the interviewing process and interview products. Holstein and Gubrium are dissatisfied with the orthodoxy that interviews are usefully regarded as opportunities for enterprising scientists to mine minds. They reject the notion (so often hidden in the way we think of survey research) that crisp answers to clean questions can be recovered with professional dispatch once the ground rules are explained by the interviewer to the respondent.

To Holstein and Gubrium, interviews are social productions. With this orientation, respondents are better seen as narrators or storytellers, and ethnographers are cast as participants in the process. Working together, the interviewer and narrator actively construct a story and its meaning. Interviewing, then, is inherently collaborative and problematic.},

@conference{Yates2005,
	Abstract = {This paper is drawn from a case-study of one school, in which hospitality and IT are each offered as subjects that can be take for dual accreditation (towards a HSC/TER score; and as a Certificate 2 Training competency). The study used interviews with teachers and students, observations, and analysis of documentary materials to show that different worker identities are being emphasised in the two classes, and that these in turn draw on different experiences and identities of the teachers of the two subjects; conflicting epistemologies of the two assessment regimes; and different student cohorts in the two subjects. The comparative site-based methodological approach taken in this project helps to explore the continued salience of two different types of theoretical takes on young people and 'transition': the Bourdieuean perspectives on schooling, cultural capital and 'reproduction'; and the attention paid by a number of scholars to changing forms of identity work for vocational purposes in 'new times'. The paper argues that those who most easily meet the rhetoric of the 'new vocationalism' are the students least identified as vocationally oriented; and raises questions about the extent to which class and gender dispositions are presumed as well as reproduced in the new initiatives.},

@conference{Palmieri2005,
	Abstract = {Notions of the 'good teacher' are common in the field of education research but, by and large, they focus on teachers who work in school education. The idea of the 'good teacher' in vocational education and training is less evident - both in everyday popular experience and in research. Yet the notion of the 'good teacher' establishes a moral claim about the professional culture of the teacher and the occupational culture that they serve which apply within vocational education as much as in school education. The idea of the 'good teacher' is political because it provides a basis for asserting the characteristics valued in different domains of vocational education and for defending particular teaching and learning traditions that are occupationally based. It establishes an anchor point for vocational teachers who are living the rapid reconfiguration of vocational education within the globalised knowledge economy, subject to intense commercial imperatives and oriented towards learning modes that reposition the teacher and the roles they are expected to play in a self-service learning context. This paper discusses the challenges of developing an approach to defining a good teacher in VET. It canvasses alternative perspectives from which the vocational teacher can be viewed and explores connections between pedagogical and occupational identity through the interplay of texts, contexts and experience.},

A fundamental assumption of many learning scientists is that cognition is not a thing located within the individual thinker but is a process that is distributed across the knower, the environment in which knowing occurs and the activity in which the learner participates. In other words, learning, cognition, knowing and context are irreducibly co-constituted and cannot be treated as isolated entities or processes.},

This paper draws on a large ARC Discovery research project that sought to; identify the qualities of artistic knowing across arts disciplines, identify gaps in the present approaches to the assessment and evaluation of arts learning and teaching and discover ways that digital technologies might be used to improve the scope, depth, relevance and frequency of feedback in arts assessment. Through a series of multiple-arts case studies, digital portfolio systems were developed and observed as part of a system of storage and management of artistic artefacts and processes for assessment. The research outcomes suggest that using digital tools does enable a more rigourous and accountable or `better' means of assessment of music learning but that there are a series of issues which arise from this process which need to be examined in further detail. Whilst the research's primary aim was to develop protocols to address these issues this paper identifies these issues as areas where questions need to be asked that synthesise context, users and systems into an effective integrated feedback proce research assets in a rigourous and accountable way.},

	Abstract = {SSEYO Ltd., UK Internet company and creator of Koan software for generative music and sound environments, today launched the world's first ever collaborative virtual generative composition, SSEYO Koan oasis 198. Pioneering artists, including Brian Eno, BRiTs producer of the year 1996 for David Bowie's 'Outside', who have contributed to SSEYO Koan oasis 198 have all used SSEYO Koan Pro 2 to create their generative components. SSEYO Koan Pro 2 was last week selected as one of the UK's Millennium Products, so chosen by the national Design Council run initiative because of their innovative and forward looking nature. Each SSEYO Koan oasis is an empty ``container'' Koan piece placed on a webpage at SSEYO's website which contains links to a number of Koan Artist's contributions, each around 1-5Kb, plus a number of small SoundFonts or samples, typically around 20Kb. When a listener visits the webpage the linked contributions are downloaded to create a composite virtual work on the listener's PC. Koan\$\^{oases}\$ are made possible by SSEYO's massively Interactive Koan Music Control (IKMC) and its capability to asynchronously download Koan files and sound samples in the background. ``SSEYO hopes to learn more about the potential of Internet community creativity and further grow the pioneering online Koan community through the creation of many genuine shared works of generative art'' said Tim Cole, SSEYO Co-Founder and Managing Director. ``We expect the SSEYO Koan\$\^{oases}\$ to have the highest production values possible, given the constraints of bandwidth, soundcards and samples and we hope that many more similar Koan community experiences will spring up all over the Internet.''. As SSEYO Koan software has incredibly powerful and rich inbuilt support for Creative Labs AWE range of soundcards, including use of SoundFonts and special MIDI controller features, the Koan artists contributing to SSEYO Koan\$\^{oasis}\$ 198 have taken full advantage of this support to create a work specifically for these PC soundcards. Users of the Creative Labs Inspire Internet product can hear the Koan\$\^{oasis}\$ immediately without having to separately download the SSEYO IKMC, thus directly benefiting from Creative Labs integration of the necessary components of the SSEYO IKMC into Inspire. C. Hock Leow, Vice President Multimedia Division and Strategic Development, Creative Labs Inc., said ``Creative Labs is pleased that its SoundFont downloadable sound technology forms an integral part of the `Ultimate Koan Experience'. SSEYO have long been supporters of Sound Blaster AWE soundcards. It is very exciting that our hardware is being used by such innovative artists, in combination with SSEYO's revolutionary IKMC, to provide AWE owners with such a rich musical experience on the web''.},

Now, scholars in several disciplines consider that the brain is a Darwin machine, too. Underpinning Darwinism is a generative heuristic, in which entities (or variants) are generated, and later subjected to tests. Entities which survive the testing are re-generated, and so on. This heuristic offers considerable value for technology-and-science education. This article, the first of a set of two, is devoted to an exposition of the science on which such a view of learning is based. In the second article, we pursue the implications for technology-and-science learning and teaching of holding such a view.},

Extracts from 3 conversations (of many, spanning 5 months) between 1 teacher and the mentor illustrate this teacher's changing ideas and the mentor's role.

Creativity appears to be an important component of problem-solving and other cognitive abilities, healthy social and emotional well-being, and scholastic and adult success. Yet the study of creativity is not nearly as robust as one would expect, due in part to the preponderance of myths and stereotypes about creativity that collectively strangle most research efforts in this area. The root cause of these stereotypes is the lack of adequate precision in the definition of creativity. The body of the article is devoted to specific suggestions for conceptualizing and defining creativity to maximize its potential contributions to educational psychology.},

In particular, design-based research methods can help with the problem of methodological alignment: ensuring that the research methods we use actually test what we think they are testing. I argue that our current notions of rigor overemphasize certain types of rigor at the expense of others and that design-based research provides an opportunity to select different inferential trade-offs. I describe how 1 design-based research trajectory evolved over time in a way that helped ensure that the learning theories being studied were well represented by the planned interventions and that the interpretation of outcomes was grounded in an understanding of not only the research design, but how the research played out in practice when enacted in real classrooms.},

There is still a significant lack of clarity surrounding methodological and epistemological features of this body of work. In fact, there is a broad variety of theory being developed in this mode of research. In contrast to recent efforts to seek a singular definition for design experimentation, I argue that methodological and epistemological issues are significantly more tractable if considered from the perspective of manifold families of theoretically framed design-based research. After characterizing a range of such families, I suggest that, as we deliberate on the nature of design-based research, greater attention should be given to the pluralistic nature of learning theory, to the relation between theory and method, and to working across theoretical and methodological boundaries through the use of mixed methods. Finally, I suggest that design-based research-with its focus on promoting, sustaining, and understanding innovation in the world-should be considered a form of scholarly inquiry that sits alongside the panoply of canonical forms ranging from the experimental, historical, philosophical, sociological, legal, and interpretive.},

Results indicate there was no relationship between the level of the prompt and the level of the responses. Higher level prompts did not necessarily generate higher level responses.

This descriptive case study used a social cognitive model of self-regulated learning (SRL) to investigate how six graduate students used and adapted traditional SRL strategies to complete tasks and cope with challenges in a Web-based technology course; it also explored motivational and environmental influences on strategy use. Primary data sources were three transcribed interviews with each of the students over the course of the semester, a transcribed interview with the course instructor, and the students' reflective journals. Archived course documents, including transcripts of threaded discussions and student Web pages, were secondary data sources. Content analysis of the data indicated that these students used many traditional SRL strategies, but they also adapted planning, organization, environmental structuring, help seeking, monitoring, record keeping, and self-reflection strategies in ways that were unique to the Web-based learning environment. The data also suggested that important motivational influences on SRL strategy use-self-efficacy, goal orientation, interest, and attributions-were shaped largely by student successes in managing the technical and social environment of the course. Important environmental influences on SRL strategy use included instructor support, peer support, and course design.

	Abstract = {A proprietary course management system, Blackboard(TM), was used to develop a Web-based unit for a group of music students enrolled in Southern Cross University's Bachelor of Contemporary Music program. The unit was unique in that it represented the first attempt made in the Centre for Contemporary Music to facilitate the teaching and learning of practical instrumental music skills via the Web. The unit featured instructional videos that were designed to supplement the resident drum teacher's conventional face-to-face teaching. Feedback from students was obtained through online forums, face-to-face discussions and a short survey. Students reported that the instructional video files were useful as stand-alone learning resources. In addition, they acknowledged the benefits of using these video files in the context of a course management system with compartmentalized supporting material and communication forums. Students were assigned the task of discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the instructional videos in online forums. This strategy proved useful to engage them in the subject matter and in the continuous improvement of these learning resources. The study revealed some evidence that the self-contained discussion forums and student Web page templates helped to foster a sense of community among the online learners as they interacted with each other and their teacher. All students involved expressed their support for the general concept of Web-assisted music teaching and learning, however, some also expressed concern about such innovation leading to reduced emphasis on one-on-one and small group tuition.},

	Abstract = {Within the field of qualitative research, autoethnography is becoming more widely known as a useful and appropriate approach. This form of self-narrative places the self within a social context and as a result a person learns how they are defined by the world, and how to redefine themselves and their relationships with others through on going reflection. This paper discusses a project that investigates individual learning at different organisational levels within a developing university in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over a three year period. The author defines autoethnography, outline the aims of the project and explores the nature of individual learning within the social context of a UAE university setting. Informal and implicit learning at different organisational levels and the impact of organisational cultural agents on that learning are discussed. The development of identities of self as an individual negotiates an organisation are addressed. The author also discusses the strengths and challenges when studying informal and implicit teacher learning and suggests future directions for research. Finally, the paper identifies ways in which methodology used in this specific context has applicability for offering fresh ideas and creative solutions within a broader international context.},

Advantages and disadvantages are discussed. In particular the struggle between utilizing closeness to empirically rich situations and avoid the closure following from being (staying) native is highlighted. Some ideas for self-ethnographic work in organization studies are developed.},

@article{Ogle2006,
	Abstract = {Most scholarly work is written from the perspective of the author being a unitary subject occupying a sole, rational, and unified position. This article argues that scholarship may be enhanced by the author adopting multiple subject positions as a methodological framework. Such an adoption is advantageous in working against the romance of the notion of a single truth while also maintaining teleological values congruent with critical and feminist agendas. This article outlines the conceptual development of this methodological framework, the rationale for its development, an explication of the concept of multiple subjectivity, and an exemplar of its application within nursing research.},

@article{McAllister2001,
	Abstract = {Deliberate self-harm is a traumatic experience which has serious consequences at individual and social levels. Differing motivations for self-harm and different modes of injury require that therapeutic responses vary. Yet, according to the literature and personal observation, nursing responses tend to be uniform and inflexible. Not only are such responses inadequate for effectively dealing with individuals who self-harm, they also have unintended, hidden deleterious consequences for nurses and nursing. In this paper, a story about self-harm is analysed using a postmodern perspective that helps to illuminate multiple dimensions to this complex issue. The approach enriches understanding, opening up possibilities to improve the quality of the nurse--patient relationship.},
